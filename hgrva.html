        <H1>COAL</h1>
        <P>Coal is a solid fossil fuel formed from the decomposition of ancient plant matter. It is primarily used for electricity generation, steel production, and as a heating source. However, the combustion of coal releases large amounts of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and other pollutants into the atmosphere.</P>
        <H1>OIL</H1>
        <P>Oil, also known as crude oil, is a liquid fossil fuel formed from the remains of ancient marine organisms. It is primarily used for transportation, as a fuel for vehicles and aircraft, and as a feedstock for the production of various petrochemicals. The extraction, refinement, and burning of oil contribute to significant environmental pollution.</P>
        <h1>NATURAL GAS</h1>
        <P>Natural gas is a gaseous fossil fuel formed from the decomposition of organic matter. It is used for heating, electricity generation, and as a fuel for vehicles. While natural gas is often touted as a cleaner fossil fuel, its extraction and combustion still release greenhouse gases and other pollutants into the environment.</P>

                <h2>FOSSIL FUELS</h2>
                <p>Fossil fuels, including coal, oil, and natural gas, have been the primary sources of energy for much of the world's industrial and economic growth over the past century. However, the combustion of these fuels has also led to significant environmental pollution, with far-reaching consequences for our planet. This presentation will explore the various types of fossil fuels, the processes involved in their usage, and the devastating impact they have had on the environment, from air pollution to climate change.</p>

            <h5>Combustion</h5>
            <p>The burning of fossil fuels, known as combustion, is the primary process that releases energy from these fuels. During combustion, the carbon and hydrogen in the fuel react with oxygen, producing heat, carbon dioxide, and water vapor</p>
            <h5>Emissions</h5>
            <p>The combustion of fossil fuels also releases a variety of pollutants, including carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, and heavy metals. These emissions can have serious consequences for air quality, human health, and the environment.</p>
            <h5>Environmental Impact</h5>
            <p>The emissions from fossil fuel combustion contribute to a range of environmental issues, such as acid rain, smog, and the enhancement of the greenhouse effect, leading to climate change and global warming.</p>
